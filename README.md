# Database Management System (DBMS) Applications

This repository contains two applications for database management systems (DBMS) - one written 
in Java using JDBMS and Swing, and the other written in Python using SQLAlchemy and PyQt5.

## Java Application
The Java application is a desktop-based DBMS tool that allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a PostgreSQL database. 
The application uses JDBMS to interact with the database and Swing for the GUI. 
The application is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with features such as query execution, data visualization, and a simple interface for managing database tables.

## Python Application
The Python application is also a desktop-based DBMS tool that allows users to interact with a PostgreSQL database. 
The application uses SQLAlchemy to communicate with the database and PyQt5 for the GUI. 
The application provides a user-friendly interface for performing CRUD operations on the database, as well as a query editor for executing SQL queries.

To use the Python application, you will need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your computer, along with the following dependencies:
* SQLAlchemy
* PyQt5

You can install these dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install -r DB_LAB3.2/requirements.txt
```
